# Planetary-Data

The add() method can be used to insert a row into the data.

The count_moons_of_planets_with_rings() method returns the total number of moons of all planets with rings. It runs in O(n) time complexity with no extra space.

The get_most_common_gas() method returns the name of gas which is available on maximum number of planets. It runs in O(n) time complexity with O(n) extra space. A hash map is used for this method to decrease time complexity.
